# reproducibility-alignn

This repo contains the code for the paper *"A reproducibility study of graph neural networks for materials property prediction"* by K. Li *et al* [Link to add]. This study aims to reproduce the [work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-021-00650-1) conducted by K. Choudhary and B. DeCost, which centered on the development of Atomistic Line Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN) models for improved prediction of materials properties.
